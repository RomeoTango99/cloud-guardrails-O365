# Manage Administrative Access

## Objective

Establish access control policies and procedures for management of administrative privileges.

## Key Considerations

* [ ] Implement a mechanism for uniquely identifying and authenticating organizational users, non-organizational users (if applicable), and processes (for example, username and password).
* [ ] Change default passwords.
* [ ] Configure password policy in accordance with [GC Password Guidance](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/password-guidance.html).
* [ ] Minimize number of guest users; add only if needed.
* [ ] Determine access restrictions and configuration requirements for GC-issued endpoint devices, including those of non-privileged and privileged users, and configure access restrictions for endpoint devices accordingly.
**Note:** Some service providers may offer configuration options to restrict endpoint device access. Alternatively, organizational policy and procedural instruments can be implemented to restrict access.

## Validation

* [ ] Confirm that a privileged account management plan and process has been documented.
* [ ] Confirm password policy aligns with [GC Password Guidance](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/password-guidance.html) as appropriate.
